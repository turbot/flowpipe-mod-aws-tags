# AWS Tags mod for Flowpipe

Pipelines to detect and correct AWS resource tag keys and values based on a provided ruleset.

## Documentation

- **[Hub â†’](https://hub.flowpipe.io/mods/turbot/aws_tags)**

## Getting Started

### Requirements

Docker daemon must be installed and running. Please see [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for more information.

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads) and Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew install turbot/tap/flowpipe
brew install turbot/tap/steampipe
```

Install the AWS plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install aws
```

Steampipe will automatically use your default AWS credentials. Optionally, you can [setup multiple accounts](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#multi-account-connections) or [customize AWS credentials](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/aws#configuring-aws-credentials).

Create a `credential_import` resource to import your Steampipe AWS connections:

```sh
vi ~/.flowpipe/config/aws.fpc
```

```hcl
credential_import "aws" {
  source      = "~/.steampipe/config/aws.spc"
  connections = ["*"]
}
```

For more information on importing credentials, please see [Credential Import](https://flowpipe.io/docs/reference/config-files/credential_import).

For more information on credentials in Flowpipe, please see [Managing Credentials](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/credentials).

Clone the mod:

```sh
mkdir aws-tags
cd aws-tags
git clone git@github.com:turbot/flowpipe-mod-aws-tags.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
flowpipe mod install
```

### Configuration

To start using this mod, you need to configure some [input variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#input-variables).

The simplest way to do this is to copy the example file `tags.fpvars.example` to `tags.fpvars`, and then update the values as needed. Alternatively, you can pass the variables directly via the command line or environment variables. For more details on these methods, see [passing input variables](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-variables#passing-input-variables).

```sh
cp tags.fpvars.example tags.fpvars
vi tags.fpvars
```

> TODO: Docs on the core variables: database, approvers, etc.

### Configuring Tag Rules

The `base_tag_rules` variable is an object defined as below. It allows you to specify how tags should be managed on your resources. Let's break down each attribute and how you can configure it for specific use cases.

```hcl
variable "base_tag_rules" {
  type = object({
    add           = optional(map(string))
    remove        = optional(list(string))
    remove_except = optional(list(string))
    update_keys   = optional(map(list(string)))
    update_values = optional(map(map(list(string))))
  })
}
```

#### Add: Ensuring Resources Have Mandatory Tags

If you require all your resources to have at least `environment` and `owner` tags, you can use the `add` attribute to apply these tags to resources that currently do not have the specific tag along with a default value.

```hcl
base_tag_rules = {
  add = {
    environment = "unknown"
    owner       = "turbie"
  }
}
```

In this example, the map key is the tag you want to ensure exists on your resources, and the value is the default value to apply.

#### Remove: Ensuring Resources Don't Have Prohibited Tags 

Over time, tags can accumulate on your resources for various reasons. You can use the `remove` attribute to clean up tags that are no longer wanted or allowed from your resources.

The example below shows how to remove any tags from our resources that are `password`, `secret` or `key`.

```hcl
base_tag_rules = {
  remove = ["password", "secret", "key"]
}
```

However, the above example only caters to exact matches on those strings. Since keys in AWS are case-insensitive, we might miss tags like `Password` or `ssh_key` as these aren't exact matches.

To achieve these kinds of matches, we support an `operator:pattern` syntax which takes a PostgreSQL operator and a pattern separated by a `:`. For more information on these see the [Supported Operators](#supported-operators) section. 

A more realistic approach would be to remove tags which contains `password`, begins with `secret` or ends with `key`, and these should all be case-insensitive matches. This would look like the example below.

```hcl
base_tag_rules = {
  remove = ["~*:password", "ilike:secret%", "~*:key$"]
}
```

Any tags which do not match one of the patterns in the list will be retained.

#### Remove Except: Ensuring Resources Only Have Permitted Tags

Another approach to cleaning up your tags is to ensure that you only have those that are desired or permitted and that all others are removed. You can use the `remove_except` attribute to define a list of patterns for retaining matching tags, where all other tags are removed.

As this is the inverse behavior of `remove`, it is recommended that you only use one of these attributes to avoid conflicts. Both follow the same `operator:pattern` matching behavior.

Lets say we want to ensure our resources **only** have the following tags:
- `environment`
- `owner`
- `cost_center`
- Any that are prefixed with our company name `turbot`

This would look like the following example:

```hcl
base_tag_rules = {
  remove_except = ["environment", "owner", "cost_center", "~:^turbot"]
}
```

Any tags which do not match one of the above patterns will be removed from the resources.

#### Update Keys: Ensuring Tag Keys Are Standardized

Over time your tagging standards may change or you may have variants of the same tag that you wish to standardize, you can use the `update_keys` attribute to reconcile tags to a standardized set.

For example, we may have want to consolidate tags for `environment` and `cost_center` where we've previously used shorthand tags for our standard (`env` and `cc`), as well as remediate common spelling errors such as `enviroment` or `cost_centre`.

```hcl
base_tag_rules = {
  update_keys = {
    environment = ["env", "ilike:enviro%"]
    cost_center = ["cc", "~*:^cost_cent(er|re)$", "~*:^costcent(er|re)$"]
  }
}
```

Behind the scenes, this works by creating a new tag with the value of existing matched tag and then removing the existing matched tag.

#### Update Values: Ensuring Tag Values Are Standardized

Similarly to keys, you may want to change the standards of the values over time or correct common typos. You can use the `update_values` attribute to reconcile values to expected standards.

This works in a similar way to `update_keys` except that there is an extra layer of nesting to group the updates on a per-key basis.

For example, lets say that you want to ensure the following happens:
- For `environment` tag, any previous shorthand or aliases are standardized into the long version of the name as the new standard.
- For `cost_center` tag, any values which have non-numeric characters are replaced by your default cost center.
- For `owner` tag, anything previously held by `Nathan` or `Dave` is now owned by `Bob`.

```hcl
base_tag_rules = {
  update_values = {
    environment = {
      production        = ["~*:^prod"]
      test              = ["~*:^test", "~*:^uat$"]
      development       = ["~*:^dev"]
      quality_assurance = ["~*:^qa$", "ilike:%quality%"]
    }
    cost_center = {
      "0123456789" = ["~:[^0-9]"]
    }
    owner = {
      Bob = ["~*:^nathan$", "ilike:Dave"]
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- TODO: Add documentation about `default` for non-matching values if we get this in. -->

#### Complete Tag Rules

Now that you understand each of the attributes available in the `base_tag_rules` object individually, you can combine them to create a complex ruleset for managing your resource tags. By leveraging multiple attributes together you can achieve sophisticated tagging strategies.

> Note: Using `remove` / `remove_except`
>
> Ideally, you should use either the `remove` or the `remove_except` attribute, but not both simultaneously. This ensures clarity in your tag removal logic and avoids potential conflicts.
>
> - `remove`: Use this to specify patterns of tags you want to explicitly remove.
>- `remove_except`: Use this to specify patterns of tags you want to retain, removing all others.

When using a combination of attributes to build a complex ruleset, they will be executed in the following order to ensure logical application of the rules:

1. `update_keys`: Start by updating any incorrect keys to the new expected values.
2. `add`: Add missing mandatory tags with a default value. This is done after updating the keys to ensure that if update has the same tag, the value isn't overwritten with the default but kept.
3. `remove`/`remove_except`: Remove any tags no longer required based on the patterns provided and old tags which have been updated.
4. `update_values`: Finally once the tags have been established, the values will be reconciled as desired.

Lets combine some of the above examples to create a complex ruleset.

```hcl
base_tag_rules = {
  update_keys = {
    environment = ["env", "ilike:enviro%"]
    cost_center = ["cc", "~*:^cost_cent(er|re)$", "~*:^costcent(er|re)$"]
  }
  add = {
    environment = "unknown"
    owner       = "turbie"
    cost_center = "0123456789"
  }
  remove_except = [
    "environment", 
    "owner", 
    "cost_center", 
    "~:^turbot"
  ]
  update_values = {
    environment = {
      production        = ["~*:^prod"]
      test              = ["~*:^test", "~*:^uat$"]
      development       = ["~*:^dev"]
      quality_assurance = ["~*:^qa$", "ilike:%quality%"]
    }
    cost_center = {
      "0123456789" = ["~:[^0-9]"]
    }
    owner = {
      Bob = ["~*:^nathan$", "ilike:Dave"]
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that:
- Firstly, the keys are updated, so we can safely perform the next rules on those keys.
- Secondly, any missing required tags are added.
- Thirdly, any tags that are no longer required are removed.
- Finally, the values are updated as required.

#### Supported Operators

The below table shows the currently supported operators for pattern-matching.

| Operator | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `=`      | Case-sensitive exact match |
| `like`   | Case-sensitive pattern matching, where `%` indicates zero or more characters and `_` indicates a single character |
| `ilike`  | Case-insensitive pattern matching, where `%` indicates zero or more characters and `_` indicates a single character |
| `~`      | Case-sensitive pattern matching using `regex` patterns. | 
| `~*`     | Case-insensitive pattern matching using `regex` patterns. | 

If you attempt to use an operator *not* in the above table, the string will be processed as an exact match, e.g: `!~:^bob` wouldn't match anything that doesn't begin with `bob` but instead only matches if it is exactly `!~:^bob`.
